# DepartureBoards

**DepartureBoards** is a Blazor web app that uses the [PID Open API](https://pid.cz/en/opendata/) to display customized public transport departure boards for Prague. Users can select and manage their favorite stops and platforms for quick access.

You can try it live at: https://departureboards.azurewebsites.net

## Motivation

I created this app because the PID Lítačka app doesn't offer an easy way to view a specific departure board — like the physical displays you see at tram or bus stops. This project is a digital version of those real-world boards.
